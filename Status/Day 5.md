# Question 16

### **Question:**

>***Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.***
>***Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:***

```
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
```

>***Then, the output should be:***

```
1,3,5,7,9
```

----------------------

### Hints:
>***In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.***

-------------------
**Main author's Solution: Python 2**
```python
values = raw_input()
numbers = [x for x in values.split(",") if int(x)%2 != 0]
print ",".join(numbers)
```
----------------
**My Solution: Python 3**
```python
lst = [i for i in input().split(',') if int(i) % 2]
print(",".join(lst))
```

# Question 17

### **Question:**

>***Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log from console input. The transaction log format is shown as following:***
```
D 100
W 200
```
* D means deposit while W means withdrawal.

>***Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:***
```
D 300
D 300
W 200
D 100
```
>***Then, the output should be:***
```
500
```

### Hints:
>***In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.***

-------------------
**Main author's Solution: Python 2**
```python
import sys
netAmount = 0
while True:
    s = raw_input()
    if not s:
        break
    values = s.split(" ")
    operation = values[0]
    amount = int(values[1])
    if operation=="D":
        netAmount+=amount
    elif operation=="W":
        netAmount-=amount
    else:
        pass
print netAmount
```
----------------
**My Solution: Python 3**
```python
total = 0
while True:
    s = input().split()
    if not s:            # break if the string is empty
        break
    cm,num = map(str,s)    # two inputs are distributed in cm and num in string data type

    if cm=='D':
        total+=int(num)
    if cm=='W':
        total-=int(num)

print(total)
```
